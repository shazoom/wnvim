# wnvim
An Applescript applet which launches Neovim in Terminal.app or iTerm2.app. 
It is designed to integrated Neovim into GUI tools which can open files 
in your prefered editor.

It has run and read handlers. Opening it allows Terminal or iTerm to be 
chosen (iTerm works better; it closes automatically when nvim exits,)
your choice will be saved in the preferences directory in you home directory
using ApplescriptObjc to access the Foundation framework. wnvim.app can 
be selected in Finder, and as default application. Works well with 
applications, such as,: Devonthink and Marked.

It only works with versions of iTerm which have the newer API and
the stock terminal app.
